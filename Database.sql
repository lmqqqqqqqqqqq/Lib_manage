Ê This is a different Data Structures book. It uses a common language like C to teach Data Structures. Secondly, it goes far beyond merely explaining how Stacks, Queues, and Linked Lists work. The readers can actually experience (rather than imagine) sorting of an array, traversing of a doubly linked list, construction of a binary tree, etc. through carefully crafted animations that depict these processes. All these animations are available on the downloadable DVD. In addition it contains numerous carefully-crafted figures, working programs and real world scenarios where different data structures are used. This would help you understand the complicated operations being performed an different data structures easily. Add to that the customary lucid style of Yashavant Kanetkar and you have a perfect Data Structures book in your hands.
